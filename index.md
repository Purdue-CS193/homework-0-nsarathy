### Jekyll Themes
### (I probably changed the theme)

#### Just going to leave everything below unchanged in case I mess up

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/kalutes/CS193_Fall18_Lab1/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
